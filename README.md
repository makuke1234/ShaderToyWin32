An OpenGL toy screen saver to test fragment shaders. Everything has been written in pure C, only Win32 API has been utilised to make it work. All OpenGL functions that must be linked, are linked at runtime, thus no OpenGL library is needed.


# Get started

To try it out download the screen saver from [here](https://github.com/makuke1234/ShaderToyWin32/releases). Both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows binaries are provided.

You can use any shader for it as long as the name of the shader file is `shader.glsl`.


# Examples

There are some shaders to "play" with in the subfolder [testingshaders](https://github.com/makuke1234/ShaderToyWin32/tree/main/testingshaders), these originate from [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) and have been modified to work with this shader engine.
